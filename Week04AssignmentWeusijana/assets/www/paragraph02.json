    "content": "In 1968 Alan Kay and his colleagues in the Learning Research Group at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) propose the Dynabook as a book-sized computer to run dynamic simulations for learning. 'The Dynabook would carry an encyclopedia of information inside its circuits and plug into readily available networks containing the sum of human knowledge. Anybody from grade school up would be able to program it to do whatever was wanted. And there's no reason it would even have to be a book; it could just as well be a wristwatch, or woven into a T-shirt."
